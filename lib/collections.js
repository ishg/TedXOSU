          'Cynthia Amoah is a spoken word artist who started her artistry through national poetry recitation competitions and motivational talks. An activist in her own right, her literary pieces often highlight the forgotten stories of the world, while transcending the often times marginalized groups that she delineates in her work. It sounds, in fact, like a large part of what she believes God put her on this Earth to do: to use words, whether written or spoken, to breathe life into spaces, and moments, where silence has masqueraded itself as king. Cynthia aspires to leave an indelible mark on the way in which we discuss race, gender and classism through her literary works.'
